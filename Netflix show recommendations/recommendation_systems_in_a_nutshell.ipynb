Therefore this notebook is just a simple guide or representation to learn about them. Content based, Collaborative and Hybrid recommendation systems are successfully implemented. Content based recommendations are easy to implement but lack precision. On the other hand, collaborative filtering is a tad bit difficult to implement but gives better results. The LightFM model is a good option too, but i think it is just a complicated implementation of collaborative filtering."
